/*****************************
* CODING CHALLENGE 3
*/

/*
John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.

To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function).
He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is
between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

    let percentage;

        percentage = 0.2;
    } else if (bill >= 50 && bill < 200) {
        percentage = 0.15;
    } else {
        percentage = 0.1;
    }
    return percentage * bill;
}
console.log(tipCalculator(100)); // 15  // test to see if function is working at 15% since bill >= 50 and < 200
console.log(tipCalculator(200)); // 10  // working at 10% since bill >= 200
