# Everything is an Object: Inheritance and the Prototype Chain
## Object-Oriented-Programming

* **Two types of Values :** **Primitives** and **Objects**.

* **Primitives:** **Numbers**, **Strings**, **Booleans**, **Undefined** and **Null**.

* **Everything else (is an object):** **Arrays**, **Functions**, **Objects**, **Dates**, **Wrappers for Numbers**, **Strings** and  **Booleans**.

* **OOP :** **Objects** that are interacting with one another through **methods** and **properties** and are used to **store data** while **structuring applications into modules** and keeping code clean.

* With help of **Constructor functions**, we can create as many **instances of an object** as we want.

* **Constructors** act as **blueprints** for other **objects** with the same **properties**.

* **Inheritance :** When one **object** is based on another object. Also, when one **object** gets **access to another object**.
* **Properties and methods:** One **object** **inherits** these **properties and methods** from another **object**.

* **JavaScript** is a **prototype** based language. **Inheritance** works by using **prototypes** and the **prototype chain**.

* Each **JavaScript object** has a **prototype property** which makes **inheritance** possible in JS.

* **Prototype property** of an object is where we put **methods** and **properties** that we want other **objects** to **inherit**.

* The **Constructor's object prototype** is not the **prototype** of the **constructor's object prototype** itself, but of all instances that are created through the blueprint of the **original constructor object**.

* The **constructor's prototype property** is the **prototype** of the first instance.

* The **original constructor object** is an instance of an even part of a bigger **constructor** with it's own properties.

### (The Object Object)
* Each object that we create is an **instance** of the **Object Constructor** which **inherits** a bunch of **methods** from the **Object Constructor's properties** (prototype chain).

* **Prototype chain:** Is what makes all of this **inheritance** possible. When we try to **access** a certain **method** or **property** on an **object**, JS will first try to find that method on that exact object. If it cannot be found,
it will look in the **Object's prototype**, which is the **prototype property** of its parent **(moving up in the chain)** if method is still not there, it keeps going up the chain to find the method until there are no more
prototypes to look into **(null)**. **Null** is the only one that has no prototype and is therefore the final link in the prototype chain. In this case, **(Undefined)** is returned.

* The **Constructor's prototype property** is **NOT** the **prototype** of the **Constructor** itself, it's the prototype of **ALL** instances that are created through it.


## Creating Objects using the Function Constructor


    var john = { // Using Object Literal
    name: 'John',
    yearOfBirth: 1990,
    job : 'teacher'
    };

    var Person = function(name, yearOfBirth, job) { // Function Constructor (pattern for writing a blueprint)

        this.name = name; // attach "this" to function of this particular execution context
        this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth; // the 'this' variable is an object as well
        this.job = job;
        this.calculateAge = function() {
            console.log(2018 - this.yearOfBirth);
        } // added using the prototype property below on line 77
    };

* When we use the **new** operator, a brand new empty object is created. After that, the constructor function
(Person) is called with the arguments we specify. Object is created then function is called. When we call a
a new function, we create a new execution context that also has a this variable

* In a regular function call, the **this** variable is applied to the global execution context. In this example of our function Constructor, having the **this** variable pointing to the Global constructor would not be very useful. That's why we use the **new** operator. It makes it so the the **this** variable of the function points to the empty object that was created in the beginning by the *new* operator.
The **new** variable points to the new Person variable (empty object), not to the Person variable

* We have to add all the methods and properties that we want to be inherited into the **Constructor's prototype
property**.

        Person.prototype.calculateAge = function() {

        // grab the prototype property from the function constructor
        and add the calculateAge method

        console.log(2018 - this.yearOfBirth);
        };

        Person.prototype.lastName = 'Smith';

        // adds last name to all instances of constructor even though it
        wasn't added to constructor object but instead in the prototype
        property of the function constructor. So John, Jane, Mark inherit
        this property

## Adding methods to our objects


    var john = new Person('John', 1990, 'teacher');

    // how we create new objects using the constructor function
    // Instantiation ( instance of the Person object )

    var jane = new Person('Jane', 1969, 'designer');
    var mark = new Person('Mark', 1948, 'retired');

    john.calculateAge(); // 28
    jane.calculateAge(); // 49
    mark.calculateAge(); // 70


    console.log(john.lastName); // Smith
    console.log(jane.lastName); // Smith
    console.log(mark.lastName); // Smith

### Using the console to examine Objects created with the constructor function

    console.log(john);
     // Person {name: "John", yearOfBirth: 1990, job: "teacher"} // properties created in our new instance
        job: "teacher"
        name: "John"
        yearOfBirth: 1990
         __proto__: Object */ // the prototype of the 'john' object // Prototype property of the Person Constructor

### *Comparison in console*

    // john.__proto__ === Person.prototype // True
    // The prototype of john is the prototype property of the Person function Constructor
    // If you open the second level proto in the console, you get the __proto__ of the Object function Constructor (object Object)

    // console-- john.hasOwnProperty('job'); // true for instance of its own property
    // console-- john.hasOwnProperty('lastName'); // false because it is not john's own property but instead inherited from the prototype


    // console-- john instanceof Person // true because it was created through Person function Constructor

### Proving almost anything is an Object
        // try in console //

        var x = [2, 4, 6]
        console.info(x) (3) [2, 4, 6]
        0: 2
        1: 4
        2: 6
        length: 3

        // length property we've used before stored here in this array instance
        __proto__: Array(0)

        // we see array function constructor properties available for array prototype

        x.length = 3 because the length property is stored in the array property
        // we have access to all of the array methods because they are stored in the prototype chain (inheritance)


## Object.create methods

* Another way to create objects that inherit from a prototype
1. define an object that will act as the prototype
2. create a new object based on that very prototype

* Using the **object.create** way instead of **function constructor**
/*
var personProto = { // no capital because it's not a function constructor
    calculateAge: function(){
        console.log(2016 - this.yearOfBirth);
    }
};

        var john = Object.create(personProto); // pass the object that we define to be the object prototype as args
        john.name = 'John'; // the old way without using 'this'
        john.yearOfBirth = 1990;
        john.job = 'teacher'; // not ideal way of using object.create because of manually entering data for this object



        var jane = Object.create(personProto, { // object.create accepts a second parameter
        name: { value: 'Jane' },
        yearOfBirth: { value: 1969 },
        job: { value: 'designer' }
        });

* The difference between **object.create** and **Constructor pattern** is that the **object.create** builds an object that inherits directly from the one that we passed into the first argument while in the **Function Constructor** the newly created object inherits from the **Constructor's prototype property**.

* One of the biggest benefits of **object.create** is that it allows us to implement a really complex **inheritance** structure in an easier way than **function constructors** because it allows us to directly specify which object should be a prototype.

* Most popular method is using the **Function Constructor**

### Primitives vs Objects

* **Primitives:** Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null.

* **Everything else (is an object):** Arrays, Functions, Objects, Dates, Wrappers for Numbers,

* Big difference between **Primitives** and **Objects** is that variables containing **Primitives** actually hold that data inside of the variable itself.

* In **Objects**, variables associated with objects do not actually contain the object but instead they contain a **reference to the place in memory** where the object sits or where the object is stored. A variable declared as an object does have a real copy of the object, it just points to that object.

## Primitives

        var a = 23; // 46 // was reassigned to 46
        var b = a; // 23 // here we simply copied the value of a to b. when we changed a = 46 it did not affect the value of b
        a = 46; // mutate var a to 46
        console.log(a); // 46
        console.log(b); // 23*/

    // each of the variables hold their own copy of the data. They do not reference anything.
## Objects

    var obj1 = {
	    name: 'John',
	    age: 26
    };

    var obj2 = obj1; // we don't actually create a new object here, no copy was created here.
    All we did was create a new reference which points to the new object. So the obj1 and obj2
    variables both hold the reference that point to the exact same object in the memory

    obj1.age = 30;

    console.log(obj1.age); // 30
    console.log(obj2.age); // 30 // when we pass a primitive and an object into a function

## Functions

    var age = 27;
    var obj = {
	name: 'Jonas',
	city: 'Lisbon'
    };

    function change(a, b) { // created a function that
	    a = 30;
	    b.city = 'San Francisco'; // the city in the object has changed from Lisbon to San Francisco
    }
        change(age, obj); // we pass the age variable holding a primitive and object variable holding a reference to an object into our function
    // This function as it was invoked attempted to change the arguments that we passed into it.
        console.log(age); // 27 // the primitive has remained unchanged
        console.log(obj.city); // San Francisco // the city in the object has changed from Lisbon to San Francisco

    // this shows us that when we pass a primitive into a function, a simple copy is created

    // we can change a as much as we want and we can never affect the variable on the outside
    because it is a primitive but when we pass an object, it's not really the object that we passed
    but instead the reference of the object

    // We do not pass an object into a function but instead only the reference that points to the object

    // when we change the object inside of the function it is still reflected outside of the function


## First Class Functions: Passing Functions as arguments


* A **first class function** is a function that was built with the intention of being passed around to other functions.

* It does one specific thing, does not have side effects, and is not intended to be called directly, but rather, to be **used by other functions**.

* Those **‘other functions’** which accept one of those **‘first class functions’** as an argument are called **higher order functions**. **Higher order functions** also might be functions that return a function.

* In a **higher order function**, when one of the parameters passed in is a function, that function is a **callback function** because it will be called back and used within the higher order function.

* A **higher order function** is named as such because when using a **callback** to perform an operation within itself, the function has a **‘higher’ purpose** than a regular function. When it returns a function, it also has a ‘higher’ purpose.

* A **function** is an instance of the **Object type**. Because of that, a function behaves like any other object.

* We can store **functions** in a **variable**.

* We can pass a **function** as an **argument** to another **function**.

* We can return a **function** from a **function**.

        var years = [1990, 1965, 1937, 2005, 1998];

        function arrayCalc(arr, fn) {  // we pass the array  and then we pass the function that calculates the array

	        var arrRes = []; // create new empty array that we will fill and return or use later

	        for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // created function that loops over array

		    arrRes.push(fn(arr[i])); // use push method to insert element at end of array // the result of calling our fn function
		    // we pass the current element of our input array into the function // fn is callback function
	        }
	    return arrRes;
        }
* Callback functions are functions that we pass into functions that will then be called later. In this case fn

        function calculateAge(el) { // receives el element and returns back age
	        return 2016 - el;
        }

        function isFullAge(el) { // The 'el' parameter will take a value of arr[i]
            return el >= 18; // comparison operator // returns true or false
        }

        function maxHeartRate(el) { // pass generic el (element) as input
            if (el >= 18 && el <= 81) {
            return Math.round(206.9 - (0.67 * el)); // age is el // Math.round method rounds to nearest integer
            } else {
            return -1;
            }
        }
 #### *Using Ternary Return:* `(el >= 18 && el <= 81 ? Math.round(206.9 - (0.67 * el)) : -1);`

    var ages = arrayCalc(years, calculateAge); // store function as variable ages so we can use it later

    var fullAges = arrayCalc(ages, isFullAge);

    var rates = arrayCalc(ages, maxHeartRate);

    console.log(ages); // (5) [26, 51, 79, 11, 18] // was called 5 times and the calculateAge function pushed new values into array that we returned

    console.log(fullAges); // (5) [true, true, true, false, true]

    console.log(rates);

## Functions returning Functions


    function interviewQuestion(job) {

    if (job === 'designer') {
        return function(name) { // anonymous function
            console.log(`${name}, can you please explain what UX design is?`);
        }
    } else if (job === 'teacher') { // variable teacher will now be teacher function
        // just like storing a function expression as a variable

        return function(name) {
            console.log(`${name}, what subject do you teach?`);
            }
    } else {
        return function(name) { // here we return an object that happens to be a function
            console.log(`Hello ${name}, what do you do ?`);
            }
        }
    }

    var teacherQuestion = interviewQuestion('teacher'); // variable teacher will now be teacher function
            // just like storing a function expression as a variable
            // function that creates questions for teachers

    teacherQuestion('John'); // John what subject do you teach?
    // calling variable which is a function and put 'John' in it because this function accepts a (name) in it as an input

    // With this method we can write one generic function and then create many more specific functions based on that generic function

    var designerQuestion = interviewQuestion('designer');

    designerQuestion('Jane'); // Jane can you please explain what UX design is?
    designerQuestion('John');
    designerQuestion('Mark');

    interviewQuestion('teacher')('Mark'); // different way of calling function
    // will return a function and can call it right away
    // works because it is evaluated from left to right
    // interviewQuestion('teacher') returns a function
    // then we call the function that was returned before with ('Mark)


 ## Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)


* A **function** cannot be accessed from the outside scope because of the **scoping chain**

        function game() {
        var score = Math.random() * 10;
        console.log(score >= 5);
        }
        game();


        (function() { // first use () parentheses, then write an anonymous function
            var score = Math.random() * 10; // because of IIFE, you cannot access the score variable from the outside
            console.log(score >= 5);
        })(); // Then we invoke the function ()     // here we created data privacy

        function () { // If you use it this way as an anonymous function,  the JavaScript parser will throw an error because
            // it will think this a function declaration (without a name). We basically have to trick the parser into thinking
            // we have a javascript expression and not a declaration. The solution is to wrap the whole thing into () parentheses
        }

        (function() { // in javascript, what is inside parentheses () cannot be a statement. Also if it was not parentheses, it
        // would never be called and never do anything and since it's not attached to a variable, nothing would ever happen

        }); // ; is used because the parser thinks it's a function expression not a declaration

        (function(goodLuck) { // first use () // using a parameter in an IIFE
            var score = Math.random() * 10;
            console.log(score >= 5 - goodLuck);
        })(5); // passing 5 as the argument for the goodLuck parameter // can only call IIFE once because it's not assigned to a variable
        // used to create a new scope that is hidden from the outside scope. Where we can safely use variables that are not used outside
        // and don't interfere with variables that are available in our global execution context



## Closures


* An **inner function** always has access to the **variables and parameters** of its **outer function**, even after the outer function has returned.

* What makes **closures** interesting is even after a function returns and the execution context is gone, the variable object is still there stored in memory and can be accessed. The current execution context has closed in on the outer variable object so that it can use it. That's why it's called a **closure**.

* Any **function** that uses a **variable** from **outside the scope** is a **closure**.

* The **scope chain** is like a **pointer** to all of the **variable objects** that the **function** has access to

* We can access the **variables** that were created in the retirement function long after the function has completed its execution and after its execution context is gone. The current **execution context** has **'closed'** in on the **outer variable object** so that it can use it. That's why it's called a **closure**. So the **scope chain** always stays in tact. The **function** returns and the execution context gets **popped off the stack**.


        function retirement(retirementAge) {
            var a = ' years left until retirement';
            return function(yearOfBirth) { // anonymous function
            var age = 2018 - yearOfBirth;
            console.log(`${retirementAge - age} ${a}`);
            }
        }

        var retirementUS = retirement(66); // we store the returned function into a variable

        retirementUS(1990); // pass yearOfBirth as argument and call // 38  years left until retirement
        // retirement(66)(1990); // immediately returns and calls a new function (date of birth) // 38  years left until retirement
        var retirement
        console.dir(retirementUS); // to look at closure

        var retirementGermany = retirement(65);
        var retirementIceland = retirement(67);

        retirementGermany(1990); // 37 years
        retirementIceland(1990); // 39 years

 ## Bind, Call and Apply Methods

* **Functions** are a special kind of **object**. Just like **Array objects**, **Functions** get special kinds of **methods** which they **inherit** from the **Function Constructor Object**

* Allow us to call a function and set the **'this'** variable manually


        var john = {
        name: 'John',
        age: 26,
        job: 'teacher',
        presentation: function(style, timeOfDay) {
        if (style === 'formal') {
            console.log(`Good ${timeOfDay}, ladies and gentlemen! I'm ${this.name}, I'm a ${this.job} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
        } else if (style === 'friendly') {
            console.log(`Hey! What's up? I'm ${this.name}, I'm a ${this.job} and I'm ${this.age} years old. Have a nice ${timeOfDay}.`);
            }
          }
        }

        var emily = {
        name: 'Emily',
        age: 35,
        job: 'designer'
        // if we want to use the presentation method from above we can use the 'call' method
        // the first argument of the call method is setting the 'this' variable
        };

        john.presentation('formal', 'morning');
        john.presentation.call(emily, 'friendly', 'afternoon'); // this is called method borrowing because we borrowed the presentation method from 'john' and applied it to the emily object // the call method allows us to set the 'this' variable here in the first argument (emily) --- call method

        // john.presentation.apply (emily, ['friendly', 'afternoon']);  // the only difference with the 'apply' method is that it accepts the arguments as an array
        // this won't work here because our method doesn't expect to see an array here

        // the 'bind' method is very similar to the call method // it allows us to set the 'this variable explicitly
        // the difference is that 'bind' doesn't immediately call the function but instead generates a copy of the function so that we can store it somewhere
        // this is useful for setting functions with preset arguments

        var johnFriendly = john.presentation.bind(john, 'friendly'); // this method will return a function a store it in the johnFriendly variable

        johnFriendly('morning'); // we have a function that is always for the friendly version of the presentation method
        johnFriendly('night'); // here we are using currying // Currying is a technique where we create a function based on another function but with some preset parameters

        var emilyFormal = john.presentation.bind(emily, 'formal');
        emilyFormal('afternoon'); // Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen! I'm Emily, I'm a designer and I'm 35 years old.
