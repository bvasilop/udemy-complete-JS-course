// Everything is an Object: Inheritance and the Prototype Chain
// Object -Oriented -Programming

// Two types of Values : Primitives and Objects

// Primitives: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null

// Everything else (is an object): Arrays, Functions, Objects, Dates, Wrappers for Numbers, Strings, Booleans

// OOP : Objects interacting with one another through methods and properties.
    // Used to store data, structure applications into modules and keeping code clean.

// With help for Constructor functions, we can create as many instances of an object as we want.
    // Constructor acts like a blueprint for other objects with the same properties

// Inheritance : When one object is based on another object. When one object gets access to another objects
    // properties and methods. One objects inherits these properties and methods from another object.

// JS is a prototype based language. Inheritance works by using prototypes and the prototype chain.
    // Each JS object has a prototype property which makes inheritance possible in JS.
